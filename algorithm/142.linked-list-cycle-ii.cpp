 *
 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no
 * cycle, return null.
 * 
 * To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which
 * represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list where tail connects
 * to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
 * 
 * Note: Do not modify the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * second node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: tail connects to node index 0
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * first node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: no cycle
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 * 
 *

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow-up:
 * Can you solve it without using extra space?
